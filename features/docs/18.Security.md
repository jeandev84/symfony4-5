### Security 


1. Create User
```
$ bin/console make:user 


 The name of the security user class (e.g. User) [User]:
 > SecurityUser

 Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 Enter a property name that will be the unique "display" name for the user (e.g. email, username, uuid) [email]:
 > 

 Will this app need to hash/check user passwords? Choose No if passwords are not needed or will be checked/hashed by some other system (e.g. a single sign-on server).

 Does this app need to hash/check user passwords? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 created: src/Entity/SecurityUser.php
 created: src/Repository/SecurityUserRepository.php
 updated: src/Entity/SecurityUser.php
 updated: config/packages/security.yaml

           
  Success! 
           

 Next Steps:
   - Review your new App\Entity\SecurityUser class.
   - Use make:entity to add more fields to your SecurityUser entity and then run make:migration.
   - Create a way to authenticate! See https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html

```



2. Add New fields related 
```
$ bin/console make:entity SecurityUser

 Your entity already exists! So let's add some new fields!

 New property name (press <return> to stop adding fields):
 > videos

 Field type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:
 > relation

 What class should this entity be related to?:
 > Video

What type of relationship is this?
 ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Type         Description                                                              
 ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  ManyToOne    Each SecurityUser relates to (has) one Video.                            
               Each Video can relate to (can have) many SecurityUser objects            
                                                                                        
  OneToMany    Each SecurityUser can relate to (can have) many Video objects.           
               Each Video relates to (has) one SecurityUser                             
                                                                                        
  ManyToMany   Each SecurityUser can relate to (can have) many Video objects.           
               Each Video can also relate to (can also have) many SecurityUser objects  
                                                                                        
  OneToOne     Each SecurityUser relates to (has) exactly one Video.                    
               Each Video also relates to (has) exactly one SecurityUser.               
 ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Relation type? [ManyToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany, OneToOne]:
 > OneToMany

 A new property will also be added to the Video class so that you can access and set the related SecurityUser object from it.

 New field name inside Video [securityUser]:
 > 

 Is the Video.securityUser property allowed to be null (nullable)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 updated: src/Entity/SecurityUser.php
 updated: src/Entity/Video.php

 Add another property? Enter the property name (or press <return> to stop adding fields):
 > 


           
  Success! 
           

 Next: When you're ready, create a migration with php bin/console make:migration
 

=================================================================================================
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```




3. User Registration
```
$ composer require symfony/orm-pack symfony/form symfony/security-bundle symfony/validator
$ bin/console make:form

 The name of the form class (e.g. OrangePopsicleType):
 > UserRegistrationFormType

 The name of Entity or fully qualified model class name that the new form will be bound to (empty for none):
 > SecurityUser

 created: src/Form/UserRegistrationFormType.php

           
  Success! 
           

 Next: Add fields to your form and start using it.

4. Security Checker [ https://security.symfony.com/check_lock ] 
```
$ composer require sensiolabs/security-checker
$ bin/console security:check
```
